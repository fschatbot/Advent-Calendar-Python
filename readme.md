## How to use

First you need to git clone the repository. You need to make sure that python is installed. Next install the requirements.txt to make sure that it works

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next you setup the config file from `config-template.py`! There are detailed steps in the file so it shouldn't that hard.

Then you can run the script with the following command:

`python main.py --year [year] --day [day]`

Running a day that doesn't exsits will create a runner file for the day. This is a public repo meaning you can create your own answers and commit to the repo.

## Journey of advent calendar

When I first learnt about advent calendar, I was sure I could solve it under minutes. Turns out I was wrong. I solved a lot of my problems in JS at start not really documenting or saving my answers. After a year or so I came back with a fresh start and I have made this github repo to track my progress.

### TODO

- If the `config.py` doesn't exist, create it from the template
- Create a github workflow that generates a site to logs all the progress
- Complete all the days from all the years
- Add a stats option so the user can see how many challenges he has completed
