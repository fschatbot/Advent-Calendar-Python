## Completion Status

Over Here you can see the completion status of the project.

Parts Completed: {flattened_solutions.count(COMPLETED)*2 + flattened_solutions.count(SEMI_COMPLETED)}/{len(solutions.keys()) * 25 * 2}
<br>
Days Completed: {flattened_solutions.count(COMPLETED)}/{len(solutions.keys()) * 25}

### Legend

- {COMPLETED} = Part Completed
- {SEMI_COMPLETED} = One of the parts have been completed
- {NOT_COMPLETED} = The Day has been attempted but not completed
- {NOT_ATTEMPTED} = Day has not even been attempted
